# Polygon Offsetting for Geofencing

This repo contains a Python and a MATLAB script for generating offset polygons from a set of 2D coordinates. The scripts were originally developed for geofencing purposes, but can be applied for other uses as well.

## Description

The script `polygon_offset.py` for Python and `polygon_offset.m` for MATLAB takes a set of 2D coordinates that make a polygon, an offseting distance, and a desired direction (inward or outward) to calculate new coordinates that make an offset polygon. The python script is more advanced than the one in MATLAB as it uses the `utm` library for Python to convert latitude and longitude coordinates to UTM coordinates, and performs the offset calculation in UTM space. The script returns the offset polygon in lat/long and UTM coordinates. The script in MATLAB doesn't have the capability of working with latitude/longitude coordinates. However, one could use the matlab function `utmconv` for that purpose.

## Inputs
- `polygon`: 2D array containing the coordinates of all vertices of a polygon
- `offset`: desired offset distance
- `direction`: direction at which the offset is desired ('i' for inward or 'o' for outward)
- `zone` and `letter`: UTM zone at which the lat/long coordinates were collected (python script only)

## Outputs
- 2D array containing the coordinates of all vertices of the offset polygon (lat/long and UTM)

## Dependencies
The Python script has the following dependencies:
- `numpy`
- `utm`

## Usage

### Python
`import polygon_offset`

geofence = [[latitude_coordinates],[longitude_coordinates]]
offset = 10
direction = 'o'
zone = 10
letter = 'N'

offset_polygon = polygon_offset(geofence, offset, direction, zone, letter)
import polygon_offset

geofence = [[latitude_coordinates],[longitude_coordinates]]
offset = 10
direction = 'o'
zone = 10
letter = 'N'

offset_polygon = polygon_offset(geofence, offset, direction, zone, letter)

### Matlab
offset_polygon = polygon_offset(geofence, offset, direction)

## Limitations
- script assumes that the input polygon is closed, i.e., the first and last vertex are the same.
- script assumes that the input polygon is simple, i.e., it does not self-intersect
- The script only works with 2D polygons.

## Examples
The repository includes example Excel files that demonstrate the usage of the script.
